    <h2>Some cool examples (copy-paste them into the "terms of the series" input):</h2>
    <ul id="examples">
        <li>
            \(\sum\frac{1}{n^2}\):
            <p>1.0/(n*n)</p>
        </li>
        <li>\(\sum\pi\frac{2}{5}^n\):
            <p>3.141592 * pow(2.0/5.0, n)</p>
        </li>
        <li>\(\sum\frac{1}{n^2+9n+20}\):
            <p>1.0/(n*n+9.0*n+20.0)</p>
        </li>
        <li>\(\sum[\arctan(n+1)-arctan(n-1)]\):
            <p>atan(n+1.0)-atan(n-1.0)</p>
        </li>
        <li>\(\sum[0.2^2-0.6^{n-1}]\):
            <p>pow(0.2, n)+pow(0.6, n-1)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you want to input your own, it uses MathJax formatting (essentially LaTeX/TeX).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How it works:</h2>
    <p>A WebGPU compute shader is used to calculate all of the terms of the series, then another is ran repeatedly to
        perform "reductions" (essentially each thread adds two values together) until there is only one value left, and
        that value is the sum of the terms and the value of the series.</p>
    <p>This value is an approximation of the infinite series with the same pattern of terms. An infinite series being
        the addition on an infinite number of terms.</p>
    <p>To guess what the actual solution of the infinite series would be, the calculated value is divided by \(\pi\),
        \(\pi^2\), and \(\pi^3\) as well as multiplied by integers up to 50. If any combination of division by \(\pi^x\)
        and multiplication by an integer \(y\) gives approximately an integer answer \(z\), it's
        probable that the exact value of the infinite series is \(\frac{z}{y}\pi\), since infinite series usually have
        nice mathematical answers like that.</p>

    <h2>Weaknesses:</h2>
    <p>While the tool is perfectly good at adding a finite number of terms, it is completely impossible to add an
        infinite number (that's what calculus is for ;). Its guess at what the value of the infinite series should be is
        quite lackluster, I'll admit. I could do it better, certainly.</p>
    <p>Firstly, you might imagine that adding an infinite amount of numbers could create an answer of "infinity". Right
        now, the tool can't tell if it's going to infinity or just a really big number. Maybe I could fix that by
        checking how quickly the value grows. If it shows no sign of stopping, it will probably go to infinity.</p>
    <p>It also tends to hallucinate things when it guesses. The guess criteria could have some more tweaking.</p>
