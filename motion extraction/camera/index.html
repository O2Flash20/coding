    <h1>Motion Extraction [Camera]</h1>
    <p>Inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/NSS6yAMZF78?si=PZ8xB8wYelJKrNuy">this video</a> (and the desire to cheat at
        video games by seeing players moving from far away), this my quick and easy solution to motion extraction in
        real time: by subtracting the current frame from one a few milliseconds before, all the pixels that stayed the
        same color in that time will go to black, letting the user see only what changed.</p>
    <p>I find it cool to have my second monitor capture the motion of my main monitor, but if only have one, you could
        set it to stream a youtube video in another tab to really appreciate the effect.</p>
    <p>Your browser might say something scary about this website seeing what's on your screen, but I assure you that
        once each frame is processed and displayed for you, it's gone forever (you can check the code <a
            href="https://o2flash20.github.io/my-random-projects/motion%20extraction/sketch.js">here</a>)</p>
    <p>If the videos don't fit on your screen, you could do [CTRL -] or [CTRL +] until they do.</p>
