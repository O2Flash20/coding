    <h1>Motion Extraction [Camera]</h1>
    <p>Inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/NSS6yAMZF78?si=PZ8xB8wYelJKrNuy">this video</a> (and the desire to cheat at
        video games by seeing players moving from far away), this my quick and easy solution to motion extraction in
        real time: by subtracting the current frame from one a few milliseconds before, all the pixels that stayed the
        same color in that time will go to black, letting the user see only what changed.</p>
    <p>If the videos don't fit on your screen, you could do [CTRL -] or [CTRL +] until they do.</p>
