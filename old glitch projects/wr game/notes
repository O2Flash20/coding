this is where (the fun begins) the game ideas go


two players

player stats: 
  Health, attack stat, defense, special 
  
initial rolls (rolls at the beginging of the game to determine player stats, they are completly random)
health: 175-200
attack: 5-10 - 11-20
defense: 10-20% absorbed
special attack: 20-30


game rules: 

player 1 rolls for stats
player 2 rolls for stats


unlimited rounds are allowed
every 3 rounds special attack is used
both take damage at the same time
first to 0 or under loses
If both players are under 0, whichever has less health loses

player 1 roles for attack -> player 2 rolls for attack
player 1 roles for defense -> player 2 rolls for defense
fight

damage taken calculation: player health - (opponent damge - (opponent damage/player defense))
