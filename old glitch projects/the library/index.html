        The Infinite Library
    </h1>

    <h7>I am trying to copy the website <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/">Library of Babel</a>, a website that
        includes countless randomly generated sets of characters organised in books and pages. There are so many of
        these pages that pretty much anything ever written is on that website. I don't know if I can pull this off but,
        hey, it's a cool idea.</h7>
