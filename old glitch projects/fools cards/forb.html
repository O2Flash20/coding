        <h1>The Fool’s cards Official Rule Book</h1>
        <b>What to play with: </b><span>Preferably, each player should start with a regular deck of 54 playing cards,
            including the jokers. If you do not have a full deck for each player, you can split a deck evenly between
            players. To avoid confusion, it is better if all players have different-looking cards.</span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Who to play with: </b><span>This game can be played with two or more players.</span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Player health: </b><span>Each player starts at 30 health. The objective to win the game is to bring your
            opponent’s health to 0.</span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Turns: </b><span>This is a turn-based game. Choose a player to go first and choose an order in which players
            take their turns so that each player gets their turn. Do this however you see fit.</span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Drawing cards: </b><span>“Drawing” means putting the top card of your previously shuffled and front-down deck
            into your hand (the cards that you can see and use, but haven’t been used yet). At the beginning of the
            game, each player draws 10 cards, then chooses 7, shuffling the rest back into their deck. On their first
            turn, each player draws one card. On their second turn, each player draws two cards, and so on. The maximum
            amount of cards that you can draw per turn is 5.</span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Factory cards: </b><span>On each of your turns, you are able to put one card of your choice from your hand
            onto the board face down. The amount of these cards that you have on the board is the number of numbered
            (not King, Queen or Jack, and aces are “1”s) cards you can place on the board each turn. </span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Putting numbered cards on the board: </b><span>When you place a numbered card on the board, it goes into a
            face-down pile that only you can look through. </span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Creating assets: </b><span>At any point in the game, you can choose two of those cards and put them together,
            creating an asset. Once this asset is created, it leaves this pile and goes face-up so that anyone can see
            it. It cannot be changed until it dies.</span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Asset cards: </b><span>Asset cards are what you use to deal damage to your enemy and protect yourself. Asset
            cards appear in groups of two (although it is easier to consider them as one asset). The first one will
            represent the amount of damage that the asset does (strength). The second one represents the amount of
            damage that the asset can take before dying (resilience). At the beginning of every turn, this value resets
            (if it was 5 and the asset takes 3 damage, it will not die and at the beginning of the next turn, it’s
            resilience will be back up to 5 and not 2).</span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Using assets to attack and defend: </b><span>At any time during your turn, you can start an attack. To do
            this, you choose a player to attack and choose assets to attack with (you can create assets out of your
            hidden pile to use). Once this is done, the attacked player chooses assets that they control (again, they
            can also create a new asset at this point), these assets will be used to defend. The attacked player then
            decides which of their assets will defend against which of the attacking player’s assets. Once this is
            decided, the blocked assets will do damage equal to their strength to their blocker. At the same time,
            blocking assets do damage equal to their strength to the asset they’re blocking. If the damage done to an
            asset is greater than or equal to their resilience, they die and both cards making them up leave the game.
            If an asset is not blocked, it deals damage equal to its strength to the player it’s attacking. Once the
            asset is done attacking and if it survived it taps, meaning that it cant defend until it untaps after one
            cycle of the game.</span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Other playing joining an attack or defence: </b><span>If one player declares an attack on another, any other
            player is allowed to join in, either attacking or defending. All rules still apply.</span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Blocking with factories: </b><span>If damage would be dealt to you, you can divert some of that damage by
            destroying a factory card. The number on the front of the card is equal to the amount of damage it diverts.
        </span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Kings, Queens, Jacks, and Jokers: </b><span>These cards have different uses from the others. They can be
            played at any time from your hidden pile. Kings are attached to an asset and give it the ability that after
            attacking, they do not tap. Queens puts your player’s health up by 5. Jacks are attached to an asset and
            give it the ability that they do damage before they take it. If the opposing asset(s) are killed, they
            cannot do their damage. Jokers cancel all damage during the turn that they were played. If only one joker is
            played at a time, your cards tap as if they all attacked. If two jokers are played at a time, they do not
            tap. For every joker that your opponents play in the same step, it acts as if you placed one joker
            less.</span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Order of steps: </b><span>This game has specific steps. You can only do certain actions of their
            corresponding steps. All steps are optional: you don’t need to do an action on each step.</span>
        <br><br>
        <b>Running out of cards: </b><span>If you run out of cards in your deck, you will be unable to draw cards and
            will have to try to win using the cards that you still have on the board.</span>
