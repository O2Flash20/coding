    <p>Since I counted all of the html, js, and glsl code for the 1KB limit, it's on a seperate page,
        <b><a href="minified.html">that you can see here.</a></b>
    </p>
    <p>In total, all of the code for what you see on that page is 985 bytes.</p>
    <p>I used the boilerplate code for an animated frag shader that's on the Genuary website. You can find that
        <a href="https://genuary.art/tinycode">here.</a>
