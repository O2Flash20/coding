        <h1><u>Distance Minimization Tool</u></h1>
        <p><b>What does it do? </b>The goal of this program is to find the ideal positions of points so that the
            distance
            from every pixel to the nearest point is the lowest possible.</p>
        <p><b>What's up with "Number of iterations"? </b>Every time it tries to find the ideal positions, the points
            start
            in a new random arrangement, and therefore the final positions of the points may be different each
            time. By calculating with multiple starting arrangements, it can ensure that the "best" arrangement is
            actually
            the best it can be. If you want to see what I mean, take some time to look at my example
            situation below. Notice how the number of red dots on the head, arms, and legs change with each iteration.
        </p>
        <p>That being said, for most situations, if you leave it running for many iterations, the difference between the
            "worst" and "best" ones it find will only be around half a percent. So there's no need to leave this running
            for
            hours, 10 iterations will be plenty (unless you really need the absolute perfect solution).</p>
        <p><b>What's a density map?</b> If you want to use this tool to solve your own situation, you can import your
            own
            density map. This would be a square, black and white image (like the one with the red dots on it at the
            bottom
            of this page) where the lighter the color is at a specific point, the more "people" "live there". Black
            means
            no-one's there. The gray exactly halfway between while and black has exactly half the amount of "density"
            white
            does. The more dense (light) a location is, the more incentive there is for a point to be near it.</p>
        <p><b>How can I get the results? </b>At the bottom of the page, there's a "Download Results" button. This will
            download:
        <ol>
            <li>An image showing you the best places to put the points on the density map (the red dots).</li>
            <li>A .json file containing x-y pairs for the position of each point, each point being numbered. Note that
                the
                top left of the density map is (0, 0) and the bottom right is (600, 600).</li>
        </ol>
