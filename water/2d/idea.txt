a texture is a grid of "water" where the brightness is the density
a compute shader works to see what the density at each pixel should be each frame
    the derivative of density is the force that each pixel should feel
        adding an external force then is just adding to the derivative
        go straight from force to position? not realistic but maybe it doesn't matter/not noticeable
        if not, have force affect a velocity field, and then have that affect the density field
    each pixel looks at those around it and its new value is the sum of all the pixels whose force are pointing straight at it
    then blur a bit after each frame to simulate a higher resolution / tiny randomness?

density could be interpreted as wave height
